# Swipper frontend

This is international collaboration project between Oamk and Fontys universities. 
Project idea was to provide a platform where users can add their own animal or search already listed animals.

## My participation
In the beginning I was part of the desining process and helped to get final desing done. 
When coding phase started my main tasks were implementing Match page and settings. Later on I did bug fixing and added some features.

### Match page

Match page is additional way to search listed animals. User can like animal by swiping right or by clicking the like button. 
When card is swiped to left, card goes under the deck and will appear again if deck is finished.   

### Feed page

Feed page displays all listed animals. User can filter listings to find specific animals.
